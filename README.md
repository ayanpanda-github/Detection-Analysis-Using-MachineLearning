# Detection-Analysis-Using-MachineLearning
# Proposed System
The proposed smart intrusion detection system (IDS) is regarded as an efficient
means of securing networks and safeguarding them from outside threats. Machine
learning techniques have been widely used in intrusion detection as the current IDS
frequently has a lower detection rate under fresh attacks and has a significant overhead
when working with audit data.
Our suggested approach uses Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Descent, and Gaussian Naive Bayes as learning
methods to address the classification issues of pattern recognition and intrusion
identification.
The issues of few samples, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality can be more
effectively handled by Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression,
Random Forest, Gradient Descent, and Gaussian Naive Bayes when compared to other
classification techniques.


### ADVANTAGES :
* high accuracy on detection rates,
* comparing time of analysis,
* getting the most efficient model for our program.


# Implementation of the System
Python is used to implement the suggested work along with thenecessary libraries scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and others. Dataset was downloaded
from kdd.ics.uci.edu. The data that was obtained includes separate train and test sets
with four distinct classes of incursions. The testdataset is regarded as a test set, and the
traindataset as a train set.

The KDD dataset was used to collect the dataset for the intrusion detection system,
and machine learning algorithms such decision trees, regression, random forests, and
KNN were used.

# Experimental Analysis/ Testing
The proposed work is implemented in Python 3.6.4 with libraries scikit-learn,
pandas, matplotlib and other mandatory libraries. The training dataset of KDD
contains 125973 rows. The test dataset contains 22543.
Machine learning algorithms are applied such as decision tree, Logistic
regression and Random forest. We used these machine learning algorithm and
identified intrusion
