# Detection-Analysis-Using-MachineLearning
# Proposed System
The proposed smart intrusion detection system (IDS) is regarded as an efficient
means of securing networks and safeguarding them from outside threats. Machine
learning techniques have been widely used in intrusion detection as the current IDS
frequently has a lower detection rate under fresh attacks and has a significant overhead
when working with audit data.
Our suggested approach uses Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Descent, and Gaussian Naive Bayes as learning
methods to address the classification issues of pattern recognition and intrusion
identification.
The issues of few samples, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality can be more
effectively handled by Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression,
Random Forest, Gradient Descent, and Gaussian Naive Bayes when compared to other
classification techniques.
